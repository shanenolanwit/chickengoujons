           <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <span>Serverless Computing (or simply Serverless) is an emerging programming paradigm for cloud-based applications. Being a natural progression from the micro-services architecture, the paradigm is widely accepted as the future of cloud-development. With Serverless, the developers can focus on the application logic, leaving the issues of security and scalability to the cloud provider. As the rivalry between Serverless vendors intensifies (e.g. the competition between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure for the $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI project), they continue to refine their offerings. This study designs a architecture that can be deployed across multiple Serverless platforms to take the full advantage of their strong-points. With AWS and Azure chosen for the study, the architecture can be either distributed across the two platforms or deployed on each of them individually. Using clearly defined metrics the study will evaluate performance of all possible deployments. The results of this study can be used to help developers choose a suitable deployment configuration based on the performance requirements.</span>
